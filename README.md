Movie Revenue Classification Using PySpark

As part of my portfolio, I developed a machine learning project aimed at classifying movies into high or low revenue categories. 
The objective was to predict whether a movie would attract strong sales based on various features such as genre, release date, etc
This project was undertaken for, XYZ Movieplayer, who sought insights to guide investment in potential blockbuster films.

Using PySpark, I created a Spark session to efficiently handle and process large movie datasets. 
I began with extensive data cleaning, addressing missing values and inconsistent entries to ensure data quality. 
Next, I performed feature engineering, transforming raw features into meaningful inputs for the modelâ€”this included one-hot encoding for categorical variables, normalization of numerical features, and deriving new attributes like budget-to-runtime ratios.

With the data prepared, I split it into training and testing sets, applied classification models and evaluated performance.
Finally, I used the trained model to make predictions on unseen data.

This project highlights my ability to build scalable machine learning pipelines in PySpark, from ingestion to model deployment, while delivering business insights.
